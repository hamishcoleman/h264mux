As part of streamlining a raspberry pi webcam setup, I would like to take the
stream output of raspivid and encapsulate it in normal framing for simpler
playback on multiple devices.

This can be done with vlc using something like:
    raspivid -o - -t 0 -vf -hf -w 1280 -h 720 | \
    cvlc stream:///dev/stdin \
        --sout '#standard{access=http,mux=ts,dst=:8090}' :demux=h264

However, vlc is a large program and slow to run, so it would be nice to have
something more targeted.

The raqspivid output is recognised by file(1) as:
    "JVT NAL sequence, H.264 video @ L 40"

The stream generated by cvlc with mux=ts (as above) is a MPEG transport stream.

Eventually, it would be nice to update raspivid with some additional output
format options, but first - I need to understand the bitstream format.
